# wp-data-kpis
Measure various kpis and present them in a unified way.

This is how the plugins is intended to work:

* This plugin measures a number of KPIs.
* The KPIs can be delivered by other plugins.
* One filter is used to find out the set of possible KPIs to measure. Other plugins can implement the filter and thereby add to the number of possible KPIs to measure. Adding a KPI would be done something like this for the plugin:
```
function myplugin_register_kpis($kpis) {
	$kpis[]=array(
		"name"=>"itemsBought",
		"title"=>"Bought items",
		"description"=>"Measures "
	);

	return $kpis;
}

add_filter("register_kpis","myplugin_register_kpis");
``` 
* One filter will be used to actually measure the KPIs. The code should, whenever it is asked, return the value for its KPIs from the last 24 hours. The code to return the data from a plugin would look like:
```
function myplugin_measure_kpis($values) {
	global $wpdb;

	$val=$wpdb->get_var("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM checkouts WHERE timestamp>=DATE_SUB(NOW(),INTERVAL 1 DAY)");
	$kpis["itemsBought"]=$val;

	return $kpis;
}

add_filter("measure_kpis","myplugin_measure_kpis");
```
* When gathering KPIs, the granularity of how to measure it is fixed and it is per day. It is not necesarily the only way to display the information. But the way that it is measuerd is always per day.
* It is possible to create a "dashboard" or "data view". In order to create a data view, a number of KPIs are specified. The data view will the historical values of these KPIs as different charts. One line on the chart per KPI.
* It is possible to create new KPIs by combining existing ones with an expression. For example, it would be possible to create the KPI `numberOfItemsBoughtPerVisitor` using the formula `itemsBought / numberOfVisitors`.
* The plugin has a REST endpoint to deliver all the current values of all defined KPIs.
* The plugin can be configured to combine data gathered at other sites. This can be done in two ways:
  * The plugin can go an ask the other sites for the current KPI values, using the REST API.
  

## Motivation

There are a number of plugins to measure things in WordPress, see e.g. [here](http://socialmetricspro.com/social-media/10-most-popular-wordpress-analytics-plugins-review/2739/). However, they all have a number of limitations:
* The kind of data that is measurable by those plugins is coded into the plugin.
* It is not possible easily to combine data that comes from different places.
