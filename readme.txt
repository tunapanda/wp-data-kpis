Some small things to think about if you want to contribute to this plugin:
* Don't update the README.md file. Update the readme.txt file, then build the
  README.md file using `make readme`. This in turn uses the
  [wp2md](https://github.com/wpreadme2markdown/wp-readme-to-markdown) command,
  so this needs to be installed on your system.
